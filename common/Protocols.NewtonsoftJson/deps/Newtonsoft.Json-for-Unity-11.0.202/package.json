  "description": "Json.NET is a popular high-performance JSON framework for .NET\n\nThis package is a fork of Newtonsoft.Json containing custom builds targeting standalone, portable (UWP, WP8), and AOT targets such as all IL2CPP builds (iOS, WebGL, Android, Windows, Mac OS X, et.al).\n\nNote: This version in particular is a backport of the changes made to Json.NET on to v11.0.2. If you can, you should always use the most up-to-date version. This version exists to support those that have hard dependency on older versions.\n\nThis package is licensed under The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright © 2019 Kalle Jillheden (jilleJr)\nhttps://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity\n\nCopyright © 2016 SaladLab\nhttps://github.com/SaladLab/Json.Net.Unity3D\n\nCopyright © 2007 James Newton-King\nhttps://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json\n\nSee full copyrights in LICENSE.md inside package\n",
